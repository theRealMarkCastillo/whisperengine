# WhisperEngine Vector-Native Memory System Requirements - LOCAL-FIRST
# Local Docker deployment with no external API dependencies (except LLM endpoints)

# Core Vector Database & Embeddings (LOCAL)
qdrant-client==1.11.3            # Local vector database (Docker) - Python 3.13 compatible  

# Note: fastembed, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, pydantic already in core requirements
# Note: asyncpg, redis, pytest already in discord requirements  
# This file only adds NEW dependencies not in core/discord/platform requirements
# openai - embeddings replaced by fastembed (LLM endpoints still configurable)
# faiss-cpu - Qdrant handles high-performance vector search
