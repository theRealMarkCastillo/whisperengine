# Platform-Specific Optimizations
# These are automatically included based on platform detection
# All versions locked for reproducible builds

# NVIDIA GPU acceleration (Windows/Linux with NVIDIA)
# torch with CUDA support - uncomment if needed
# torch==2.8.0+cu118; sys_platform != "darwin"

# AMD GPU acceleration (Linux with ROCm)
# torch==2.8.0+rocm5.6; sys_platform == "linux"

# Apple Metal acceleration (macOS)
# Platform-specific optimizations

# No longer need PyTorch - using lightweight TextBlob for emotion analysis
# PyTorch removed to reduce dependencies and Docker image size
# torch with CUDA support - uncomment if needed
# torch==2.8.0+cu118; sys_platform != "darwin"

# ROCm support for AMD GPUs - uncomment if needed 
# torch==2.8.0+rocm5.6; sys_platform == "linux"

# macOS PyTorch removed - using TextBlob for lightweight emotion analysis
# torch==2.8.0; sys_platform == "darwin"  # No longer needed

# MLX support removed - no backend implementation exists
# TODO: Re-add when MLX backend is implemented:
# mlx==0.29.1; sys_platform == "darwin" and platform_machine == "arm64"
# mlx-lm==0.28.0; sys_platform == "darwin" and platform_machine == "arm64"
