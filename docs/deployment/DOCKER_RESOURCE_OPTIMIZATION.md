# Docker Resource Optimization Updates

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive Docker resource optimization updates made to improve multi-core CPU utilization and prevent resource contention across all WhisperEngine services.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Docker Compose (docker-compose.yml)

#### WhisperEngine Bot Container
**Before:**
- CPU: 1.0 cores (limit), 0.5 cores (reservation)
- Memory: 1.5G (limit), 512M (reservation)

**After:**
- CPU: 4.0 cores (limit), 2.0 cores (reservation)
- Memory: 4G (limit), 2G (reservation)

**Rationale:** The application uses 8-12 thread workers and 4-6 process workers, requiring significantly more CPU resources than originally allocated.

#### Redis Container
**Added Resource Limits:**
- CPU: 0.5 cores (limit), 0.25 cores (reservation)
- Memory: 512M (limit), 256M (reservation)

#### PostgreSQL Container
**Added Resource Limits:**
- CPU: 1.0 cores (limit), 0.5 cores (reservation)
- Memory: 1G (limit), 512M (reservation)

#### ChromaDB Container
**Added Resource Limits:**
- CPU: 0.5 cores (limit), 0.25 cores (reservation)
- Memory: 1G (limit), 512M (reservation)

#### Neo4j Container
**Added Resource Limits:**
- CPU: 1.0 cores (limit), 0.5 cores (reservation)
- Memory: 3G (limit), 1G (reservation)

### 2. Production Docker Compose (docker-compose.prod.yml)

#### WhisperEngine Bot Container
**Before:**
- CPU: 0.5 cores (limit), 0.25 cores (reservation)
- Memory: 1G (limit), 512M (reservation)

**After:**
- CPU: 4.0 cores (limit), 2.0 cores (reservation)
- Memory: 4G (limit), 2G (reservation)

#### Database Services
**Added equivalent resource limits for all database services** matching the main compose file configuration.

### 3. Dynamic Worker Scaling Implementation

#### Production System Integration
Updated `src/integration/production_system_integration.py` to automatically scale worker counts based on available CPU cores:

```python
# Dynamic worker scaling based on available CPU cores
cpu_count = os.cpu_count() or 4
max_threads = min(int(os.getenv("MAX_WORKER_THREADS", cpu_count * 2)), 16)
max_processes = min(int(os.getenv("MAX_WORKER_PROCESSES", cpu_count)), 8)
```

#### Concurrent Conversation Manager
Updated `src/conversation/concurrent_conversation_manager.py` to support environment-based worker configuration:

- Auto-detects CPU cores when worker counts are not specified
- Respects environment variables: `MAX_WORKER_THREADS`, `MAX_WORKER_PROCESSES`
- Applies sensible limits to prevent resource exhaustion

#### Emotion Processing Engines
Updated `src/emotion/vectorized_emotion_engine.py` to auto-scale based on CPU availability:

- Environment variable: `EMOTION_MAX_WORKERS`
- Auto-detection with reasonable limits (max 8 workers)

#### LLM Concurrent Manager
Updated `src/llm/concurrent_llm_manager.py` for adaptive scaling:

- Environment variable: `LLM_MAX_WORKERS`
- Conservative default: `max(3, cpu_count // 2)`

## Total System Resource Requirements

### Recommended Deployment Resources
- **Bot Container**: 4 CPUs, 4GB RAM
- **Neo4j**: 1 CPU, 3GB RAM
- **PostgreSQL**: 1 CPU, 1GB RAM
- **ChromaDB**: 0.5 CPU, 1GB RAM
- **Redis**: 0.5 CPU, 512MB RAM
- **Total**: ~7 CPUs, ~9.5GB RAM

### Environment Variables for Fine-Tuning
```bash
# Worker scaling
MAX_WORKER_THREADS=12           # Override thread pool size
MAX_WORKER_PROCESSES=6          # Override process pool size
EMOTION_MAX_WORKERS=4           # Emotion processing workers
LLM_MAX_WORKERS=3              # LLM API workers

# Logging configuration
FORCE_READABLE_LOGS=true        # Force human-readable logs (vs JSON)
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG                 # Set logging level
ENVIRONMENT=development         # Set environment mode
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper Multi-Core Utilization**: Eliminates CPU starvation that was preventing the application from using available processing power
2. **Resource Isolation**: Each service has defined limits to prevent resource competition
3. **Auto-Scaling**: Worker counts automatically adapt to deployment environment
4. **Performance Optimization**: Matches container resources to application expectations
5. **Production Ready**: Separate optimized configurations for development and production

## Migration Notes

- **Breaking Change**: Existing deployments will require more system resources
- **Minimum Requirements**: Host system should have at least 8 CPU cores and 12GB RAM for production deployment
- **Development**: 12GB RAM is workable but tight - monitor memory usage closely
- **Recommended**: 16GB+ RAM for comfortable development with full feature set
- **Monitoring**: Resource usage should be monitored after deployment to validate optimal allocation

## Testing Recommendations

1. Deploy updated configuration in staging environment
2. Monitor CPU utilization across all containers
3. Validate that thread/process pools are operating at expected capacity
4. Load test with concurrent user scenarios
5. Adjust worker environment variables if needed for specific deployment constraints
