# DEPRECATED: This file is being replaced by a multi-tier dependency system
# Please use the new structure for clean cross-platform support:
#
# Core dependencies (shared):     requirements-core.txt
# Platform optimizations:        requirements-platform.txt  
# Discord bot specific:          requirements-discord.txt
#
# Installation:
#   Discord Bot: ./scripts/install-discord.sh (or .bat for Windows)
#
# See DEPENDENCY_MANAGEMENT.md for full migration guide
#
# This file maintained for backward compatibility until migration complete

# Minimal compatibility installation - use new structure instead
# All versions locked for reproducible builds
