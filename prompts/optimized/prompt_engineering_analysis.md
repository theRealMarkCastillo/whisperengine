# Optimized Prompt Engineering Strategy

## Problems with Current Approach

### 1. Context Explosion
- 15+ template variables each adding 100-1000+ tokens
- 257-line base prompt = ~600+ tokens alone
- Redundant emotional context sections
- Complex nested instructions

### 2. Over-Engineering
- Too many "modes" and "systems" 
- Overly complex personality adaptation logic
- Multiple overlapping context types
- Encourages meta-analysis despite saying not to

### 3. Efficiency Issues
- Long instructions that models often ignore anyway
- Template variables that could be consolidated
- Repetitive context that doesn't add value

## Proposed Solutions

### 1. Streamlined Base Prompt
- Cut base prompt from 257 lines to ~50 lines
- Focus on core personality and behavior
- Remove redundant instructions
- Eliminate meta-analysis language

### 2. Consolidated Context Variables
Replace 15+ variables with 3-4 essential ones:
- `{CORE_CONTEXT}` - Essential user info and relationship state
- `{RECENT_CONTEXT}` - Last few conversation turns summary  
- `{MEMORY_HIGHLIGHTS}` - 3-5 most relevant memories only
- `{CURRENT_MOOD}` - Single line emotional state

### 3. Token Budget Management
- Base prompt: 150 tokens max
- Context variables: 300 tokens max total
- Recent messages: 200 tokens max
- System instructions: 50 tokens max
- **Total context: ~700 tokens** (vs current 17,000+)

### 4. Quality Over Quantity
- Focus on 2-3 key personality traits vs 10+ "modes"
- Use natural language vs technical system language
- Emphasize natural conversation vs complex analysis
- Remove contradiction between "be natural" and "use sophisticated analysis"

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Create Minimal Effective Prompt
- Strip down to core personality
- Test response quality with minimal context
- Validate token usage stays under 1000

### Phase 2: Add Essential Context Only
- Add back only the context that demonstrably improves responses
- Use A/B testing to validate each addition
- Measure token usage vs response quality

### Phase 3: Optimize Context Generation
- Summarize instead of including raw data
- Use relevance scoring to pick top memories
- Compress emotional context to single insights
- Remove redundant information

This approach should:
- Reduce context from 17k+ tokens to <1k tokens  
- Improve response consistency and quality
- Reduce API costs by 90%+
- Eliminate context-overflow errors
- Maintain personality and memory capabilities
