# WhisperEngine Memory Architecture v2.0
## The Definitive Design Document

**Document Status**: SUPERSEDES ALL PREVIOUS MEMORY DESIGNS  
**Date**: September 20, 2025  
**Version**: 2.0 - Vector-Native Memory System  
**Decision**: APPROVED - Primary Architecture

---

## Executive Summary

WhisperEngine is migrating from a problematic hierarchical memory architecture to a **vector-native memory system** based on 2023-2025 AI research. This change eliminates consistency issues, enables natural fact checking, and positions WhisperEngine with state-of-the-art conversational AI capabilities.

**Key Decision**: Replace hierarchical memory approach (Redis/PostgreSQL memory tables/ChromaDB) with unified vector-native memory. PostgreSQL remains for user management, system data, and operational needs.

---

## Research Findings & Architecture Decision

### Current Architecture Problems (TO BE REPLACED)

Our hierarchical memory system has fundamental architectural flaws:

- **❌ Consistency Issues**: Memory data diverges between Redis cache, PostgreSQL memory tables, and ChromaDB vectors (goldfish name conflicts)
- **❌ No Single Source of Truth**: Facts stored in multiple places with conflicts
- **❌ Complex Synchronization**: Cache invalidation and cross-system sync problems  
- **❌ Context Fragmentation**: Memory scattered across storage systems
- **❌ Poor Scalability**: Hierarchical bottlenecks and maintenance overhead

**What We're Replacing** (Memory-Specific Components):
- **Redis memory caching layer** → Eliminated (vector search is fast enough)
- **PostgreSQL memory tables** → Replaced by Qdrant vectors  
- **ChromaDB vector storage** → Replaced by Qdrant (better local Docker support)
- **Neo4j knowledge graph** → Replaced by vector semantic relationships (see details below)

## Neo4j → Vector Memory Migration

The current Neo4j implementation provides:
- **Topic relationships**: Connected topics and conversation patterns
- **User interest profiles**: Topic frequency and conversation patterns  
- **Session relationships**: Conversation continuity and context
- **Conversation patterns**: Related topics and themes discovery

**Vector Memory Equivalent**:
- **Semantic topic clustering**: Vector similarity naturally groups related topics
- **Interest profile via search**: Query patterns reveal user interests through vector similarity
- **Context continuity**: Temporal embeddings maintain conversation flow
- **Pattern discovery**: Semantic search finds related conversations automatically

**Benefits of Vector Approach**:
- **No explicit relationship maintenance**: Semantic similarity is automatic
- **Natural language queries**: "Topics related to pets" vs complex Cypher queries  
- **Fuzzy matching**: Finds conceptually related topics, not just exact matches
- **Simpler architecture**: One system vs separate graph database

**What We're Keeping**:
- **PostgreSQL** for user profiles, system settings, audit logs, guild configuration
- **Redis** for Discord message caching (reduces Discord API calls), session state, rate limiting, and operational performance cache

### Modern AI Research Consensus

Based on 2023-2025 research, **vector-native memory** is the industry standard for conversational AI:

- **✅ Used by ChatGPT, Claude, and all major systems**
- **✅ Single source of truth eliminates consistency problems**
- **✅ Natural contradiction detection via semantic similarity**
- **✅ Associative retrieval finds related memories automatically**
- **✅ Context coherence through vector clustering**
- **✅ Proven scalability in production systems**

## New Architecture: Vector-Native Memory System

### Core Principles

1. **Vector-First**: Everything stored as embeddings in vector space
2. **Single Source of Truth**: No data duplication or tier synchronization
3. **Semantic Intelligence**: Natural fact checking and contradiction detection
4. **Tool-Callable**: LLM can manage memory via function calls
5. **Production-Proven**: Use battle-tested AI/ML libraries only

### Technology Stack Selection

## 🏠 LOCAL-FIRST IMPLEMENTATION

**Primary Goal**: Run entirely in Docker with only LLM endpoints as external dependencies

#### Primary Vector Database: **Qdrant** ⭐ SELECTED (LOCAL)
```python
# Why Qdrant for local deployment:
# - Runs entirely in Docker container
# - No external API calls required
# - Excellent performance (Rust-based)
# - Full feature parity with cloud solutions
# - Open source with great Python SDK
# - Built-in metadata filtering
# - Scales to millions of vectors locally
```

#### Embedding Model: **sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2** ⭐ SELECTED (LOCAL)
```python
# Why sentence-transformers for local deployment:
# - Runs entirely offline in Docker
# - No API keys or external calls
# - Good quality for conversational AI
# - 384 dimensions (efficient storage)
# - Fast inference on CPU
# - Proven in production systems
# - Multilingual support
```

#### LLM Endpoints: **Flexible Configuration** ⭐ CONFIGURABLE
```python
# LLM endpoints are the ONLY allowed external dependency:
# Local Options:
# - Ollama (local container)
# - LocalAI (local container)
# - Any local LLM server
# Remote Options:
# - OpenAI API
# - OpenRouter API
# - Claude API
# - Any compatible endpoint
```

**Cloud Upgrade Path** (Optional Future Enhancement):
- **Qdrant Cloud**: Easy migration when scaling needs arise

## Detailed Architecture Design

### Memory Components

#### 1. Unified Vector Store
```python
class VectorMemoryStore:
    """Single source of truth for all memory - LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.qdrant = QdrantClient(host="localhost", port=6333)  # Local Docker
        self.embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')  # Local model
    
    async def store_memory(self, content: str, metadata: dict) -> str:
        """Store any memory (fact, conversation, context)"""
        
    async def search_memories(self, query: str, filters: dict = None) -> List[Memory]:
        """Semantic search across all memories"""
        
    async def detect_contradictions(self, new_memory: str, user_id: str) -> List[Contradiction]:
        """Find conflicting memories via similarity search"""
```

#### 2. Memory Types (All in Vector Space)

```python
class MemoryType(Enum):
    CONVERSATION = "conversation"     # Chat history
    FACT = "fact"                     # User facts (pets, preferences)
    CONTEXT = "context"               # Conversation context
    CORRECTION = "correction"         # User corrections
    RELATIONSHIP = "relationship"     # User relationship data
```

#### 3. Tool-Callable Memory Management

```python
# LLM can call these tools to manage memory
MEMORY_TOOLS = [
    {
        "name": "update_memory",
        "description": "Update or correct user information",
        "parameters": {
            "subject": "What to update (e.g., 'pet name')",
            "old_value": "Incorrect information", 
            "new_value": "Correct information",
            "reason": "Why this correction is needed"
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "search_memory", 
        "description": "Search user's memory for specific information",
        "parameters": {
            "query": "What to search for",
            "memory_type": "Type of memory to search"
        }
    }
]
```

### Data Flow

```
User Message → Embedding → Vector Search → Context Assembly → LLM → Response
                    ↓
              Fact Extraction → Contradiction Check → Memory Update
                    ↓
              Tool Call Detection → Memory Management Tools
```

### Storage Schema

#### Qdrant Vector Schema (Memory Data)
```python
# Qdrant Vector Schema - for memory/conversation data
{
    "id": "mem_user123_20250920_001",
    "vector": [0.1, 0.2, ...],  # 384-dim embedding (sentence-transformers)
    "payload": {
        "user_id": "123456789",
        "memory_type": "fact",
        "subject": "pet",
        "predicate": "is_named", 
        "object": "Bubbles",
        "timestamp": "2025-09-20T10:30:00Z",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "source": "user_message",
        "corrected": false,
        "content": "User's goldfish is named Bubbles"
    }
}
```

#### PostgreSQL Schema (System Data)
```sql
-- User management and system data (KEEP PostgreSQL)
CREATE TABLE users (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    discord_id BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    username VARCHAR(255),
    display_name VARCHAR(255),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}'
);

CREATE TABLE guilds (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    discord_id BIGINT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(255),
    settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

CREATE TABLE audit_logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id BIGINT REFERENCES users(id),
    action VARCHAR(100),
    details JSONB,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
