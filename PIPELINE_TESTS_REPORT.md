```

### âœ… 4. Production Memory Pipeline (`test_production_pipeline.py`)
**Status**: âœ… AVAILABLE

**Test Coverage**:
- Phase 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 validation
- Emotional detection pipeline
- Memory system integration
- Production bot pipeline testing

### âœ… 5. Vector Memory System (`test_tyler_art_memory_pipeline.py`)
**Status**: âœ… AVAILABLE

**Test Coverage**:
- Vector memory operations
- Character-specific memory isolation
- Conversation flow testing

## Current Production Integration

### Discord Bot Commands
Elena is **fully integrated** and ready for use:

```bash
# Start the bot
./bot.sh start dev

# In Discord, use:
!roleplay elena    # Activate Elena character
!roleplay off      # Deactivate character roleplay
```

### Elena Character Features Working
- âœ… **Character Loading**: CDL JSON parsing and character object creation
- âœ… **Personality Integration**: Elena's voice, speech patterns, expertise
- âœ… **Memory System**: Character-specific memory storage and retrieval
- âœ… **Context Enhancement**: Memory-informed responses
- âœ… **Discord Commands**: Role-play activation/deactivation
- âœ… **Cross-Character Protection**: Memory isolation between characters

### Phase 2 Memory Features Working
- âœ… **Three-Tier System**: SHORT_TERM â†’ MEDIUM_TERM â†’ LONG_TERM
- âœ… **Automatic Tier Management**: Age-based promotion/demotion
- âœ… **Memory Decay**: Significance-protected decay processing
- âœ… **Performance**: 68+ memories/sec creation, 666+ memories/sec decay
- âœ… **Vector Storage**: Qdrant + fastembed integration

## Elena Character Demonstration

### Character Profile
```json
{
  "name": "Elena Rodriguez",
  "age": 26,
  "occupation": "Marine Biologist & Research Scientist",
  "location": "La Jolla, California",
  "expertise": "Coral reef resilience and restoration",
  "personality": "Warm, enthusiastic, uses oceanic metaphors",
  "language": "Bilingual (English/Spanish)",
  "favorite_phrases": ["The ocean doesn't lie", "Â¡IncreÃ­ble!", "Data tells the story"]
}
```

### Example Conversation Pipeline
```
User: "Hi Elena! Tell me about coral restoration."

1. Memory Retrieval: [Previous coral research discussions]
2. Character Context: Elena's marine biology expertise + personality
3. Elena Response: "Â¡Hola! My research focuses on coral reef resilience 
   at Scripps Institution. The ocean doesn't lie - we're seeing incredible 
   adaptations in warming waters. Data tells the story of resilience..."
4. Memory Storage: Conversation stored with significance scoring
```
